# C-project-auto-generate-bash-script

This script allows you to generate a minimal C project, it generates it using the Meson build system.
It also automatically connects libraries to Meson.
Iâ€™ll say right away that it was mostly created for me, so there may be some inconvenient moments.

## Roadmap
* add auto project name
* add auto binary name
* add settings
* add support other languages
